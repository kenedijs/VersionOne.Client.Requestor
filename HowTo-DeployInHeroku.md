# How to deploy VersionOne.Client.Requestor in Heroku for free

You can deploy this code in Heroku under a free account. But, first be aware of this **security caveat**:

If you do it this way, you should take care to create a user in your VersionOne instance who has limited permissions, because it requires a plaintext username and password to be stored in config.js. **We welcome pull requests from developers who come up with more secure solutions for this.**

## Steps

* Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
* Follow these instructions for [modifying config.js](README.md#configjs) to point to your own VersionOne instance, and to have the correct authentication.
* Open up this document you are reading right now and modify the code for the **Deploy** button that you see below by swapping the `https://github.com/versionone` part with the path to your newly forked copy.
* Save the file.
* Press the *Deploy* button! This will walk you through the steps to create the free account and the app!
* Once finished the app will be available at `<appname_chosen>.herokuapp.com`
